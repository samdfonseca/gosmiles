## Problem Statement

To create a command line tool in Golang to convert names of simple hydrocarbons from SMILES format to IUPAC nomenclature.

### Requirements

- Input must accept the name of a compound in [Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) (SMILES) format
- Output must produce the name of input compounds in [IUPAC nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry)
- Must be implemented in Golang
- Must include tests

### Constraints

- Program only needs to handle alkanes (simple hydrocarbons) to greatly reduce the scope and complexity
- Program only needs to handle straight-chain and branched alkanes, i.e. no cyclic
- Program interface is not important (STDIN / STDOUT is fine)
