# Connamara Technologies Interview Homework

## Process Overview

This is your solution repository. **Please keep it private!**

- Fork this repository and add your changes to a branch on your fork.
- Send us Pull Requests as you go so we can guide you in the right direction

## Problem Statement

To create a command line tool in Golang to convert names of simple hydrocarbons from SMILES format to IUPAC nomenclature.

### Requirements

- Input must accept the name of a compound in [Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system) (SMILES) format
- Output must produce the name of input compounds in [IUPAC nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_organic_chemistry)
- Must be implemented in Golang
- Must include tests

### Constraints

- Program only needs to handle alkanes (simple hydrocarbons) to greatly reduce the scope and complexity
- Program only needs to handle straight-chain and branched alkanes, i.e. no cyclic
- Program interface is not important (STDIN / STDOUT is fine)

### Grading Criteria

- Code clarity
- Best practices
- Ability to implement Test-Driven Development
- Our attempts to fix or modify your code, to observe technical & process difficulty

Remember, **time is not a grading criteria.** Feel free to ask questions regarding project scope, but part of the assignment is for you to overcome the unknowns, including organic chemistry and language familiarity.

Thank you for interviewing with us and good luck!
